# Hello and welcome to CYB 2004
#
# We are going to first look at creating variables in Python.  
# We do not have to tell Python what "type" our variable is, 
# it infers it from the data we give it.

# This is a comment line.. Put your name on the following line, starting with a #


# Integer
age = 50
# String
name = "Geoffrey"
# Float
height = 6.00
# Boolean
is_student = False


# Now it is your turn, fill in these variables with different data (maybe about you, but it doesn't have to be)
age = 
name = 
height = 
is_student = 

# We can also do aritmetic in Python, with variables or actual numbers
age_in_five_years = age + 5
product = age * 2

#We can compare things
is_old_enough_to_drive = age >= 16



# Your turn.  Create a comparison statement 


#Finally, save this file, commit, and push to github
